# 43 Load Testing

For the local test I seem to be getting all connection refused errors and I'm not sure why. The pathing is accurate and same with the registration information. So not much was learned from the local load testing.

For deployed load testing the tests start to unravel a little bit around 100 users a second every 20 seconds. Not really sure why this is since we're paying for a domain on digitalocean but I guess I don't know what our plan is either.
